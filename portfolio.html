        <h4>Noteable Projects</h4>
        <h2><a href="https://conjungo.io">Conjungo</a></h2>
        <p>Conjungo is a social networking application for iOS. I built the entire project from the ground up on both the front end and back end. The back end, which features a MySQL database in addition to a PHP enviornment, is hosted by Google App Engine. The mobile application was built entirely with Apple's Swift programming language. This is by far my largest project. The initial version alone required tens of thousands of lines of code and took nearly a year to complete. I am currently working on a massive update that will make use of virtual reality headsets for new ways of interacting with the application.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://following.tech">Following Tech</a></h2>
        <p>Following Tech is a development blog I created where I post updates on my work and thoughts about future projects. This is also based on Google App Engine hosting, and relies on a MySQL and PHP back end that I developed.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://github.com/grago1999/GraphingKit">GraphingKit</a></h2>
        <p>I created this set of classes as a way of easily creating and displaying user accessible graphs in iOS applications. Any developer can use these classes to create full graphs with less than five lines of code.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://github.com/grago1999/Material-Design-for-iOS">Material Design for iOS</a></h2>
        <p>Inspired by Google's material design guidelines, I set out to replicate many UI elements for iOS. These classes allow developers to easily incorporate a number of iconic material design principles including layered views and interactive shadows.</p>
